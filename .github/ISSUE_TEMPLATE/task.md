## Description
In this section, provide a brief overview of what needs to be added or changed in the project. Be specific enough about the functionality or feature that needs improvement or enhancement so that readers can understand what needs to be done. This section should be concise but informative enough to provide context for why this task is necessary.

**Example**:
We need to add a new feature that allows users to create custom dashboards by selecting specific widgets from a predefined list because it will enable users to tailor their experience to their specific needs and preferences.

## Solution
Describe a high-level overview of what needs to be done to finish this task. Do not be too detailed here since more complex tasks will likely have a different final solution after working on the problem more closely.

This section is **omitable** if there is no clear solution.

**Example**:
To implement this feature, we need to:
1. Design a UI for creating custom dashboards by selecting widgets from a predefined list.
2. Ensure that the dashboard remains responsive and functional across various screen sizes and devices.
